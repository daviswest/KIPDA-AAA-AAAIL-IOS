### Key Features
âœ… **Real-Time Notifications** â€“ Instantly deliver updates to users.  
âœ… **Accessibility-Focused** â€“ Thoroughly tested with **native iOS accessibility features**.  
âœ… **Localization Support** â€“ Includes **localizable strings**, with potential for automated translation integration.  
âœ… **Secure Authentication** â€“ Uses **Firebase Authentication** to manage user access.  
âœ… **Cloud-Backed Data** â€“ Firebase stores and synchronizes notifications and user preferences.  

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS with **Xcode installed**
- **CocoaPods** for dependency management
- A valid **Firebase configuration file** (`GoogleService-Info.plist`)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/daviswest/KIPDA-AAA-AAAIL-IOS.git
cd KIPDA-AAA-AAAIL-IOS
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
pod install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup
Since Firebase is used for authentication and the database, you'll need to add your own `GoogleService-Info.plist` file:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.
2. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS.
3. Place it in the project directory:
   ```
   KIPDA-AAA-AAAIL-IOS/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Capstone App/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Capstone App/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ â”œâ”€â”€GoogleService-Info.plist
   ```
4. Ensure the file is added to Xcode (if applicable).

### 4. Run the App
```sh
open KIPDA-AAA-AAAIL-IOS.xcworkspace
```
- Select a simulator or connected device.
- Press **Cmd + R** to build and run the project.
